The LanAge_opt tool allows for the evaluation of the age sampling optimization effect on the age distribution of Landings 
for multiple years and gears, in a single area. 

This tool is largely based on the tool developed by Dr Laurent Dubroca for WKBIOPTIM3 (sampalk): 
Simulation on the number of age readings per length class (LC) and effect on the age structure of landings (see WKBIOPTIM3 report). 

However, the present tool allows for optimization using actual datasets (CS and CL tables of the SDEF). 

It should be noted that this approach was developed right after the WKBIOPTIM 3 meeting took place,
and thus this document serves as a draft to be discussed and elaborated by the WK during the next meeting.
