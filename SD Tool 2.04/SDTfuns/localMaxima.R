# SD Tool v.3 and WKBIOPTIM SimTool v.1  were taken into account for the developement of the present tool.
# SD tool has been developed in MARE/2014/19 project and updated in MARE/2016/22 project (STREAM)

# The tool is documented in Deliverable D3.3 "Upgrade the methodological framework and tools for sampling optimization, implement and report case studies" (January 2019)
